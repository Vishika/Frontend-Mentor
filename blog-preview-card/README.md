## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Spacing, font size, line heights, were all reused among different properties to achieve a pleasant design.

```css
:root {
  --xl: 3.2rem;
  --l: 2.4rem;
  --m: 1.6rem;
  --s: 1.4rem;
  --xs: 1rem;
  --xxs: 0.5rem;
}
```

I learned how to incorporate TTF, true type fonts

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: figtree;
  src: url(assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}
```
